/*
 * CVS/RCS Log
 * $Log: djdecode.h,v $
 * Revision 1.5  2009-10-07 12:44:33  uli
 * Switched to logging mechanism provided by the "new" oflog module.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2006-03-29 15:58:52  meichel
 * Added support for decompressing images with 16 bits/pixel compressed with
 *   a faulty lossless JPEG encoder that produces integer overflows in predictor 6.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2005/12/08 16:59:18  meichel
 * Changed include path schema for all DCMTK header files
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2001/11/19 15:13:27  meichel
 * Introduced verbose mode in module dcmjpeg. If enabled, warning
 *   messages from the IJG library are printed on ofConsole, otherwise
 *   the library remains quiet.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2001/11/13 15:56:20  meichel
 * Initial release of module dcmjpeg
